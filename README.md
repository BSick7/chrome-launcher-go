# chrome-launcher-go

This repo is inspired by [chrome-launcher](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-launcher).
However, this is intended to be used from golang.

This is useful when running a golang lambda that communicates via chrome remote interface.

An example usage is included at [local/main.go](local/main.go).
